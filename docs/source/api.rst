Python API
================================================

You can use pdal-parallelizer by importing it directly in your Python code.

There is an exemple of the usage of the API:

.. code-block:: python

    from pdal_parallelizer import process_pipelines as process

    process(config="link of my config file",
            input_type="single",
            tile_size=(100, 100),
            n_workers=5,
            threads_per_worker=2,
            diagnostic=True)

There is only one function in pdal-parallelizer:

    process(config, input_type, timeout, n_workers, threads_per_worker, dry_run, diagnostic, tile_size, buffer, remove_buffer, bounding_box, process)

Process points clouds.

**Parameters:**

- config (*str*) - Path of your config file.
- input_type (*str*) - This parameter indicates whether you are processing a single file or a list of files. It can take only two values: "single" or "dir". If single, please change the input filed of the config file to put the path of your file instead of the path of your input directory.
- timeout (*int*, *optional*) - Time before a worker is killed for inactivity. If you do not specify a timeout, you will need to specify it before the start of the run on the command line.
- n_workers (*int*, *optional*) - Number of cores you want for processing. (default=3)
- threads_per_worker (*int*, *optional*) - Number of threads for each worker. (default=1)
- dry_run (*int*, *optional*) - Number of files to execute the test.
- diagnostic (*bool*, *optional*) - Get a graph of the memory usage during the execution. (default=False)

**The following parameters are specific to the processing of a single file:**

- tile_size (*tuple*, *optional*) - Size of the tiles. (default=(256,256))
- buffer (*int*, *optional*) - Size of the buffer that will be applied to the tiles. (in all 4 directions)
- remove_buffer (*bool*, *optional*) - If True, it indicate you want to remove the buffer when your tiles are written. If you choose not to delete the buffer, it will be assigned the withheld flag.
- bounding_box (*tuple*, *optional*) - Coordinates of the bounding box you want to process. (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)
- merge_tiles (*bool*, *optional*) - This flag indicate you want to merge all the tiles at the end of a single cloud treatment.
- process (*bool*, *optional*) - If True, you will see a progress bar while the clouds are processed. (default=False)
